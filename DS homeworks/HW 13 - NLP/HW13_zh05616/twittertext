1. When the music stops and all these people lose their jobs, where will they end up

2. ‼️‼️JK & Usher's music video will be released Friday, Dec. 15 Please support because JK has worked very hard before he entered Ms‼️‼️

3. I think Santa may be getting a late addition to my List. Wow! Being in my Top 5 all time favourite albums, I just have to….. Merry Christmas and thank you for all the fabulous music you create xx

4. I need music! Send your links ASAP! 

5. The most annoying thing is that, aside Twe Twe, Holy Ghost, the rest of the songs on that top 10 Apple Music are useless songs. Umbrella deserves number one and it’s really sad to see those who put genuine work into promoting their songs getting relegated by ‘stream farmers’.

6. Probably 99.99% of all the music that has ever existed in the world has never been written down. Notation is less important than getting children to listen and sing back what they hear

7. i’m so glad that 3racha are finally getting recognised for their amazing talents, first they got nominated for best producer/arranger for the asian pop music awards, and now they actually won “best creator” at AAA

8. amazingly I let it continue playing and it redirected me, I then got some waiting line music for a few minutes at which point it hung up on me, thanks for that parcelforce. I will give up now as the anger is rising.

9. Abel is just a nice guy in general, even outside of fortnite and his music- he's so creative with his music, it makes me feel like I'm somewhere else in the world from time to time!

10. Everyone thinks that the highest effort overedited videos are what brings you virality. The opposite is actually the case. It's a science of capturing your attention through captivating hooks, hypnotical music, and proper clip selection (everyone says SOMETHING at SOME point which is worth clipping). Almost anyone can become famous. You just simply do not know how.
